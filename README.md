# midi2rumble
PoC of converting midi files to Nintendo switch Joy Con rumble data.

Requires python libraries [mido](https://pypi.org/project/mido/) and [pyhidapi](https://pypi.org/project/hid/).

The script currently expects both the Left and Right Joy Con to be connected.

[Video](https://youtu.be/XAMKwq26h4s) showing the script in action playing the doom level1 midi on my Joy Con.
